## Bugs / extending / general QOL updates

As stated above, you're definitely more than welcome to fork and keep a copy on your own GH, all I ask is if you do find a bug, please let me know as it seems this repo tens to be the one people find first.
I would also love to extend this at some point to include possibly some more general info about the location and/or possibly new JSON files for different countries. 
If you think of any cool ideas on how to extend this please make a comment in the discussions or submit a PR for the feature. There are a ton of ways extending this could further help people and 

## Extending

If you'd like to extend the data structure a bit to include some more helpful info, please just try and keep the general data structure the same. I.E. Don't add one or two properties to just YOUR specific area code and call it a day.
You can, however, create the props for every object and give values to only your zip code.
